This project is for the CS4400 Internet Applications module in my final year in Trinity College Dublin. This project
Is used to calculate the cyclomatic complexity of a repository online, such as Git.

dependencies for project:
1: flask
2: flask_restful
3: radon
4: GitPython

Note:
1: I have had issues with downloading and install pygit2 - hence I am using GitPython.
2: This program can be run through an IDE or can be run through terminal, where you can specify the number of workers
   you wish to spawn.
